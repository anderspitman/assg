I started rewriting [my personal site](https://anderspitman.net/) from scratch. As soon as I wanted to reuse some HTML, I
decided I may as well write a little SSG tailored to my needs.

See [this repo](https://github.com/anderspitman/anderspitman.net) for example content.

The code is awful. Clones and hacks everywhere. Please don't judge. I just needed something working ASAP. I promise to clean
it up as I add features ;)

I find it unlikely that anyone will want to use this anyway. Write your own; it's fun!
